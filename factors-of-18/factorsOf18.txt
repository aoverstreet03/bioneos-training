Factors of 18:

I started by running this script. It initially gave me all of the variable numbers [2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. I first looked at the if statement, if the remainder divided by the
dividend is equal to zero, it is a factor. I then looked at the if(factor) statement where 
it logged the statement. My first idea was to put "if (factor == true)" log the statement
because I was thinking that since it didn't specify whether or not the factor was true 
or false it could have been printing all of them. That made no difference at all in the 
output of the code, so I decided to go through and check that the rest of the script was 
correct. The formatting between how this would look in Python, which I am used to, and 
JavaScript look a bit different, so I went on the internet and checked the 
"var divisor = numbers[idx];" line was formatted correctly for the divisor to be the 
index of each of the numbers above. My last assumed bug would be the solution. I moved
the "console.log(divisor + ' is a factor of ' + dividend + '!');" statement out of its 
own if statement and into the previous one where we found the remainder. I ran this one
and it gave me the expected results; the remainders of 18 [2, 3, 6, 9].
