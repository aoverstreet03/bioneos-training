Mystery Table: what my idea of the proposed function does.

We are creating a function that builds a table with [count] = 4 elements.
While the count is decrementing from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1, we push (or add new elements to the table)
To fill it with numbers we go through and start at row one, and as long as it is less than 
the length of the table we will add new elements and these elements will be the count you 
are incrementing by. It will add it to the table and then return these incremented count numbers.

Returns [undefined]
